I am able to keep living in the same house in San Diego, which although much bigger than I need, allows me to stay in my familiar community and this has also saved me the stress and expense of moving.

<br>This summer, I turned 60 and I’m still having trouble believing that! I had planned to celebrate in style, but COVID tossed that plan aside. An upside of the pandemic however, was getting to spend a lot more time with Lisa than had previously been expected. She originally had grand European plans for her summer, but had to spend most of it hanging out with me in San Diego. I really enjoyed having her (and her cooking) with me, but she had to return to Bristol in September to continue her studies.

        <br>With so much time being spent at home, I decided to start changing the landscape around my house to be more water-wise. I have done quite a bit of the work myself, including digging out grass and adding a decomposed granite patio. I now have a worm farm for composting and have planted some vegetables and herbs in the backyard. My favorite addition has been a pair of Palo Verde Desert Museum trees which are really beautiful (photo below is not my tree, but they will hopefully look like this one day). </span></p>

        Gardening has brought back many fond memories of my dad, who was a very keen gardener. Also, spending time at home is not so bad when you can regularly look out of your window and see beautiful blue skies, often with hot air balloons floating by.</span></p>

        <br>My running club has been able to continue meeting by keeping us in small masked groups for our training runs. We motivate ourselves by entering virtual races that donate some of the fees to charities. We still get to collect cool medals and most of our runs are along the gorgeous San Diego coastline (photos above), so not a bad way to get exercise.</span></p>

Thanks to a new outdoor dance floor and the benign San Diego weather, we are now able to take limited classes again but only solos of course.</span></p>

        <br>Unfortunately, Lisa will not be able to spend Christmas with me this year. The rigors of two 14-day quarantines are prohibitive for her 2021 college schedule. Luckily she has a number of friends whose families have offered to take her in for the holidays. Believe it or not, this will be Lisa’s final year of her bachelor's in psychology. I am keeping my fingers crossed that restrictions will be sufficiently lifted by July to allow me to travel to the UK and attend her graduation in Bristol.</span>

    Although I have been grateful to keep my job teaching kids how to code, it has been quite the challenge to run all my classes from home via Zoom. It is so much harder to connect with students when you are not physically with them. There has been a gradual loss of business for my employer during the pandemic and subsequently a reduced income for me, so I have taken a second job to provide me with a safety net and income supplement. In November, I started working as a classroom aide in a public school kindergarten class for students with ASD. It’s a local school that I used to substitute teach at when I started teaching in 2006. I am able to walk to work which was a huge factor in making this decision. The kids are lovely but my days are very full. We have alse been warned that this job may also transition to fully remote learning, since COVID is still far from being under control here. That will be a massive challenge.
