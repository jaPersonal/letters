      <p  style='margin-left:10.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Tekton Pro"'>2022 has heralded quite a few changes for me. I started the year working two jobs, but could not sustain working so many hours. I decided to take a gamble and quit the more lucrative coding teacher job and search for a single job that would meet all my needs. After a few months of job searching, I finally landed at a wonderful charter elementary school, teaching STEAM for all grades K-5. I work with an excellent group of educators and could not be happier.</span></p>

    <p  style='margin-left:10.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Tekton Pro"'><br>Since my new job requires me to commute up and down the freeway I decided to get a new car. After much hemming and hawing, I bit the bullet and went electric and I generate enough solar power at home to charge it at no cost. I love my new Chevy Bolt EV but have not yet had the courage to take it on a long trip that would require on-the-road charging. I figure I can rent a car any time I need to go somewhere that the EV can't handle, or I might just keep my old Mazda while it still runs.</span></p>

        <br>The house has been the source of a lot of excitement this year. After designing and scheduling some bathroom and kitchen remodelling, the plumbing decided to fail in four different parts of the house causing considerable damage to a couple of ceilings and the walls under the staricase. It seemed like a whole house re-pipe was the best course of action but the remodellers did not successfully schedule that with their other activities. The end result was a 6-8 week project that turned into 5 months of construction dust and chaos. Thankfully the downstairs work was completed in time for Christmas but the master bathroom was deferred to March. It all looks lovely now, but there were many moments in which I questioned the decision to have the work done.</span></p>

 <p  style='margin-left:10.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Tekton Pro"'><br>I continued to run and dance this year, completing 5 local half marathons (photo above). Once again, I was able to dance in the US Western Region Irish Dance competition (Oireachtas) that was held in San Francisco. My team was thrilled to take first place in the ladies 8-hand competition (photo below) and my 4-hand team also scored a very respectable 4th place.

         I love to spend time by the ocean as often as possible, running along the coast or paddle boarding on the flat water at Mission Bay and Liberty Station.

    During the summer, I made the crazy decision to foster a couple of young dogs from a rescue in Mexico. I originally thought I might adopt them permanently, but my new job requires me to spend too many hours out of the home and I am hoping to soon find them their forever home.

    Lisa (above) moved to London in June and now works for The Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in the UK. She deferred her college graduation ceremony to next year and I am really hoping it will be in the summer so I can spend some time over there when I am on a break from teaching. Unfortunately, there is also a strong possibility it will be in February which is less desirable on so many levels. Keep your fingers crossed for us please!
